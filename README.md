This program has only been tested on macOS

You will need [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in order to do cool things with audio and video files

You will need the python modules [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html), [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), and [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to do cooler things with image, video, and audio data

```
